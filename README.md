## What I Learned

# Learning Objectives

In my project, I have focused on learning the following key aspects:

## 1. Exporting and Importing Databases from JSON and CSV

I have gained proficiency in exporting and importing data from JSON and CSV formats into a database, specifically SQLite 3. Key highlights include:

- **Exporting Data:** Understanding how to export data from a database to JSON or CSV files.
- **Importing Data:** Writing scripts to efficiently import JSON and CSV data into an SQLite 3 database.

## 2. Using Apex Chart in Django Projects

I have learned how to integrate Apex Charts, a powerful JavaScript charting library, into Django projects. Notable achievements include:

- **Integration:** Successfully incorporating Apex Charts into Django templates.
- **Dynamic Charting:** Making Apex Charts dynamic by connecting them to real-time or database-driven data for dynamic visualizations.

## 3. Efficient CRUD Operations on Large Datasets

I have explored efficient ways to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on large datasets. Key highlights include:

- **Bulk Operations:** Implementing techniques for handling bulk data inserts and updates efficiently.
- **Optimizing Reads:** Developing strategies to fetch and display data efficiently without causing performance bottlenecks on large datasets.

## 4. Query Optimization on Large Datasets

I have delved into optimizing database queries for large datasets, focusing on:

- **Indexing:** Utilizing indexing to improve query performance on large datasets.
- **Query Tuning:** Implementing techniques to write and optimize complex SQL queries for efficient data retrieval.

## 5. Implementing Pagination for Smooth Data Display

I have learned how to implement pagination to ensure a smooth user experience when displaying large datasets in web applications. This includes:

- **Django Pagination:** Understanding and implementing Django's built-in pagination features.
- **User Experience:** Enhancing the user experience by allowing seamless navigation and browsing of large datasets.

These learning objectives have equipped me with valuable skills and knowledge for efficiently handling and analyzing data in real-world projects.


## Challenges Faced

Throughout the project, I encountered several challenges, including:

- **Data Model Transformation:** Adapting the data model in my Stock database to accommodate JSON to SQLite 3 data conversion requirements.
  
- **Integration of REST Framework:** Overcoming hurdles in making the RESTful API responses in JSON format seamlessly interact with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **Chart Visualization:** Learning and gaining expertise in chart visualization techniques, particularly with Apex Charts, as this was a new area of knowledge for me.

These challenges presented valuable learning opportunities, and I worked diligently to overcome them in the pursuit of building a robust and dynamic stock market analysis tool.

every page has 100 data include and there are 160 pages in this project have. There is a mixed chart I have created this chart works for every page data inlcuding close in the y axis , data in the x axis , and also volume in the y axis and this chart has a select option which will take only the trade_code form current page trade_code and analyze with the current page data
